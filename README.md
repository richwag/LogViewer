# LogViewer
React/.net core logviewer project.

This is a small react/dotnet core app I used to explore working with hooks. It uses a web api to query entries in a logging database.

The client is a reactjs/typescript app. The backend is a dotnet core webapi connected to sqllite via entity framework.

This app was developed in VSCode.

To run it, get the respository and build. The database will be created and seeded on app startup.
