# LogViewer
React/.net core logviewer project.

This is a small react/dotnet core app I used to explore working with hooks. It uses a web api to query entries in a logging database.

The client is a reactjs/typescript app. The backend is a dotnet core webapi connected to sqllite via entity framework.

This app was developed in VSCode.

To run it, get the respository. Open a terminal window and run dotnet ef database update to create and seed the initial database.
Then just run it from VSCode.
